# Custom Deployment

### Getting Started

The following sections will walk you through deploying your own instance(s) of NervesHub in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/). Currently only AWS is supported via the [NervesHub Terraform](https://github.com/nerves-hub/terraform) infrastructure but this could be adapted to support the cloud services provider of your choice.
